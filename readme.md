# Azure Backend Web App connected with Mongodb

## Description üìù

Azure Web App is a cloud-based web application hosting service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to build and deploy web applications on the Azure cloud platform, using a variety of programming languages and web frameworks such as .NET, Java, Node.js, and PHP. Azure Backend Web App provides a fully managed, scalable, and secure platform for hosting your web applications, so you don't have to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

MongoDB, on the other hand, is a globally distributed, multi-model database service from Microsoft Azure. It is a NoSQL database service that allows you to store and manage data using a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family. CosmosDB provides a fully managed, scalable, and highly available database service, with built-in support for global distribution, automatic indexing, and automatic scaling.

By combining Azure Backend Web App with MongoDB, you can build and deploy modern, cloud-native web applications that can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads. Azure Backend Web App provides the web application hosting and logic, while MongoDB provides the database backend to store and manage the application data. This combination provides a scalable and reliable solution for building and deploying web applications in the cloud.
